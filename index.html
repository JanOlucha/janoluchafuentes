          Hi, I'm Jan. I did my undergraduate degree in Mathematics between 2021 and 2024 at King's College London, where I was the President of the Mathematics Student Society during my last year. I will be starting the Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge in October of 2024. This is my website where you can find my academic trajectory as well as some of the stuff I've written.

    <h2>Lecture notes:</h2>
      <p>When I was at King's College London, I typed my notes for some of the courses I took. Some people thought they were useful so here they are. The charm of these notes is not the Mathematical content itself, but rather the fact that I have included a very substantial amount of examples and questions (both from homeworks and past exams) in them. Be advised, there is foul language and (sometimes quite bad) typos and errors. This should however be sort of beneficial, for it keeps the student on their toes all the time making sure that they actually pay attention to what they are reading.</p>
